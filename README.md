# python_datascience

Contains:

- single_perceptron_public.pynb python file to demonstrate the structure of a single layer perceptron. The preceptron is coded from scratch with no packages as a simple demonstration example.
- DNN character recognition project: this folder contains a python notebook and supporting files that demonstrate using a deep neural network multi-layer perceptron backprogation learning to approximate the letter of an image.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): This folder contains a python notebook that demonstrate using a SVM model to approximate a letter of an image based on image features.
- Feature Selection Analysis: This folder contains a project on feature selection and exploratory data analysis. A dataset from Kaggle on Heart Disease is used for this project.
- Predicting Marketing Churn: This folder contains an IN PROGRESS python notebook. The project goal is to predict churn using a SVM model on marketing series data taken from Kaggle.
